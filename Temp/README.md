# Temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit

## Test 1
- Write a function to take a temperature value in Celsius as an argument and return the equivalent
temperature in Fahrenheit.

Test your function in an HTML page having three buttons that, when clicked, pass values of 10, 20,
and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively, to the function. Check that everything works to your
satisfaction.

## Test 2

- Modify the script so that your temperature
conversion function now has a default value of zero for its argument. Add an extra button to the
page that, when clicked, calls the function without passing any argument. Check that the script
correctly outputs 32 (the Fahrenheit equivalent of zero degrees Celsius) and that all the other
buttons operate as they did previously.
